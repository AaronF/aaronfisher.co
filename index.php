			<h3><a href="http://farelert.com">Farelert.com</a></h2>
			<p>Farelert makes it super easy to track the price of a flight over time. All you have to do is enter a few details about your trip and farelert will show you the results, from there you can track multiple flights and get alerted by email or text as soon as it changes. This is currently an ongoing project that we hope to launch in the new year!</p>

			<p>I helped build the iOS & Android app for getWaiter! which is a service that aims to improve your resturant experience. No more waving your hands in the air, simply scan the code on the table and use the app to call the waiter, request more drinks or get the bill.</p>
